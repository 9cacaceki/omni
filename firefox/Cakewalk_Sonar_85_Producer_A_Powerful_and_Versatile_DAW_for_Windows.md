In this article, we will highlight some of the key features and benefits of Cakewalk Sonar 8.5 Producer, and why it might be the right choice for your music-making needs.
 
## Step Sequencer 2.0
 
One of the most improved features in Sonar 8.5 Producer is the Step Sequencer 2.0. This is a powerful tool for creating rhythmic patterns and sequences using any MIDI output or software instrument. You can easily program beats, bass lines, melodies and more using the intuitive grid interface, which shows you the notes, velocity, timing, flam and portamento for each step. You can also drag and drop MIDI clips from the track view or browser into the Step Sequencer for quick editing and manipulation.
 
The Step Sequencer 2.0 also lets you convert your patterns into MIDI clips that retain their timing and groove, so you can further edit them in the Piano Roll view or use them in other applications. You can also save your patterns as presets and recall them anytime you want.
 
## Matrix View
 
Another new feature exclusive to Sonar 8.5 Producer is the Matrix View. This is a creative and flexible way of arranging your audio and MIDI clips in a non-linear fashion. You can load your clips into cells and trigger them on the fly using your mouse, keyboard or MIDI controller. You can also record your performance as a new track or export it as a new project.
 
The Matrix View is ideal for experimenting with different combinations of clips, creating variations and remixes, or performing live with Sonar. You can also sync the Matrix View with the Track View, so you can see how your clips fit into your song structure.
 
## Integrated Arpeggiator
 
Sonar 8.5 Producer also features an integrated arpeggiator that lets you trigger arpeggiations on any MIDI or instrument track. You can choose from hundreds of presets or create your own patterns using the in-depth control over all arp parameters, such as mode, octave range, step length, swing, velocity and more.
 
The arpeggiator can also be synced to the project tempo or run freely at its own speed. You can also record the arpeggiated output as a new MIDI clip for further editing or use it as a source for other effects or instruments.
 
## Virtual Instruments and Effects
 
Sonar 8.5 Producer comes with a comprehensive collection of virtual instruments and effects that cover a wide range of sounds and styles. You get 15 high-quality instruments, such as Dimension Pro, Rapture, Z3TA+, Session Drummer 3, TruePianos Amber and more. You also get tens of effects, such as Lexicon Pantheon Reverb, LP-64 EQ, LP-64 Multiband, TS-64 Transient Shaper, TL-64 Tube Leveler, VC-64 Vintage Channel and more.
 
These instruments and effects are fully integrated with Sonar's interface and workflow, so you can easily access their parameters and automate them using envelopes or controllers. You can also use VST or DirectX plug-ins from other developers if you need more options.
